## How to create a plant

To create a new plant, send a POST request to the `/plants` endpoint with the required plant information in the request body.

### Required fields

- `name` - The name of the plant
- `species` - The botanical species of the plant
- `wateringFrequency` - How often the plant needs watering (in days)

### Optional fields

- `sunlight` - Sunlight requirements (low, medium, high)
- `location` - Where the plant is located
- `notes` - Additional notes about the plant

### Example request

```json
{
  "name": "My Monstera",
  "species": "Monstera deliciosa",
  "wateringFrequency": 7,
  "sunlight": "medium",
  "location": "Living room"
}
```

The API will return the created plant object with a unique `id` that you can use for future updates or deletions.
